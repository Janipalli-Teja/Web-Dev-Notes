Debugging in the browser
Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors within a script


The “Sources” panel
The Sources panel has 3 parts:
The File Navigator pane lists HTML, JavaScript, CSS and other files, including images that are attached to the page. Chrome extensions may appear here too.
The Code Editor pane shows the source code.
The JavaScript Debugging pane is for debugging, we will explore it soon.


Console
We can type commands there and press Enter to execute.

Breakpoints
A breakpoint is a point of code where the debugger will automatically pause the JavaScript execution.
We can always find a list of breakpoints in the right panel. That’s useful when we have many breakpoints in various files. It allows us to:

Quickly jump to the breakpoint in the code (by clicking on it in the right panel).
Temporarily disable the breakpoint by unchecking it.
Remove the breakpoint by right-clicking and selecting Remove.

The command “debugger”
We can also pause the code by using the debugger command in it, like this:

function hello(name) {
  let phrase = `Hello, ${name}!`;

  debugger;  //  the debugger stops here

  say(phrase);
}
Such command works only when the development tools are open, otherwise the browser ignores it.
